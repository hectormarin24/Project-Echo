# Project-Echo
 Library Project CSC 131

 This is an application designed to be a way for users and administrators to access the information of a library database. 
 
 It allows users to either sign into or create an account. If the account belongs to a regular user, they will be directed to the Home Page, where they can view their account and take various actions regarding their account. They can pay fees, cancel reservations, view loans, and remove wishlists. There are also various pages that can be cycled through such as a contact page, about page, and credit page. Users can also search for and view information about the books in the database. They can see if it is available, put it on their wishlist, reserve the book, and loan the book.
 
 Administrators of the system can alter the information about various elements in the database, such as modifying their content, adding new elements, or deleting elements. The various elements that can be altered are books, loans, users, and reservations.
 
 When users are done with the application, it is very easy to sign out and exit the program. Thank you for using the Echo Library Application!
